    <h2>Who is The Neighbourhood?</h2>
      <p>The Neighbourhood is an American Rock band that formed in 2011.  Most of the members were childhood friends, and all of them were in bands during highschool.  On advice from their manager, the band chose the British spelling of "neighbourhood" to distinguish themselves from other bands.  The singles "Sweater Weather" and "Female Robbery" helped the band's fan base (called Hoodlums) grow.  In 2013 the band went on tour to open for Imagine Dragons.  They also toured with another popular band with a similiar style, The 1975.  In 2014 it was announced that Bryan Sammis, drummer, would be leaving the band.  They releasesd a self titled album this year.</p>
